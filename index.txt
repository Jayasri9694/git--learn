##introduction of http:##
     ->Http  is a protocal for fetchingresources such as HTML documents.
     ->It is the foundation of any data exchange on the web and it is a client-server protocal,which means request are initiated by the recipient,usually the web browser.
     ->A complete document id reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched,for instance,text,layout description,image,vedios,scripts,and more

## http1.1:
    ->The first standardized version of HTTP, HTTP/1.1, was published in early 1997, only a few months after HTTP/1.0. 
    ->HTTP/1.1 clarified ambiguities and introduced numerous improvements: A connection could be reused, which saved time.
    -> It no longer needed to be opened multiple times to display the resources embedded in the single original document.
    ->Pipelining was added. This allowed a second request to be sent before the answer to the first one was fully transmitted. 
    ->This lowered the latency of the communication.
    ->Chunked responses were also supported.
    ->Additional cache control mechanisms were introduced.
    ->Content negotiation, including language, encoding, and type, was introduced. A client and a server could now agree on which content to exchange.
    ->Thanks to the Host header, the ability to host different domains from the same IP address allowed server collocation.

    ## http 2:
    -> Over the years, web pages became more complex. 
    -> Some of them were even applications in their own right.
    -> More visual media was displayed and the volume and size of scripts adding interactivity also increased. 
    -> Much more data was transmitted over significantly more HTTP requests and this created more complexity and overhead for HTTP/1.1 connections. 
    -> To account for this, Google implemented an experimental protocol SPDY in the early 2010s. 
    -> This alternative way of exchanging data between client and server amassed interest from developers working on both browsers and servers.
    -> SPDY defined an increase in responsiveness and solved the problem of duplicate data transmission, serving as the foundation for the HTTP/2 protocol.
